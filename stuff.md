Next:
    Gun recoil and reloading

To bring back to WT:
    Greedy meshing fix obviously
    Generally better magicavoxel practices
    FREAKING SHADOWS
    And yeah.

I basically want 4 LOD levels - standard, all one color for shadows, and then really heavy LOD for far away buildings and stuff, then billboards.

Note - the coolest thing ever would be moving cars. Like in goat simulator - they don't stop or anything, they just kind of disappear out of the world. They would literally move in a completely straight line.

Then, add back the snipers and make the segway men only chase you if they have a direct line of sight to you - also bake the navmesh (that'll take a while).
Then polish guns, add reloading mainly, but fix the super weird bullet instantiate problem, maybe by scaling down guns or something.
Then, add item drops all over.
Also, fix the OP grappling gun by adding snipers - also what's really important is a TOP invisible wall.
Then add doors and more items, and random drops.
Then add destruction, just at the material level, just for laughs. Add the RPG too.
And glass.

Then last, UI update with wizard tower pixel art sprites.

Alright, it's time to finish NJ.
PLAN: Polish the UI, fix those freaking bugs.
Do as many playthroughs as possible, writing down the most important and obvious bugs (do not write down unimplemented features), fix shit and play through again until there's nothing on the list.

Maybe remove the inventory and just have the toolbar, and q to throw items, max four or five items. That's enough.

LIST:
    AI guys go straight through the buildings
    Grappling gun - doesn't work anymore.
    Can't pull up with the plane

NOTE:
Make it so that instead of nuking, you just 9/11 all the buildings like some sort of plane bulldozer, but the plane doesn't get destroyed
